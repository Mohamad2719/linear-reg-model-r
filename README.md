Coursera Course Project

This course introduced simple and multiple linear regression models. These models allowed us to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. In this course, I learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examined, and utilized regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using R statistical software.
